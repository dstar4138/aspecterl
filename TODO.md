## TODO ##

While the primary purpose of AspectErl is finished, there are a few things 
that would be nice to finish up before calling this a finished project:

* Documentation. I would like to clean up the code and document it so it serves
  to be more than just a half-baked idea.

* Fix all the TODOs in the source code.

* If two pointcuts are named the same in two different modules, they get applied
  twice. Perhaps pointcuts should be modularized?
